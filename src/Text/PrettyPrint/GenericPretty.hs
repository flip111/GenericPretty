  GenericPretty is a Haskell library that supports automatic
  derivation of pretty printing functions on user defined data
  types.

        The output provided is a pretty printed version of that provided by
  'Prelude.show'.  That is, rendering the document provided by this pretty
  printer yields an output identical to that of 'Prelude.show', except
  for extra whitespace.

        For examples of usage please see the README file included in the package.

  For more information see the HackageDB project page: <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GenericPretty>
